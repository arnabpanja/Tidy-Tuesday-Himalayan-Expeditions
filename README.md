Data Science with R


This repository has been built with the idea to have all my work in one place related to the exercises in the book R for Data Science and my work on Exploratory Data Analysis on varied topics including Tidy Tuesday. 
The first of my work relates to Tidy Tuesday - Himalayan Expeditions where I have studied the data and brought out some beautiful plots explaining the data on the Himalayan Expeditions - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/191#issue-591367784. The data set also belongs from here https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/191#issue-591367784.
