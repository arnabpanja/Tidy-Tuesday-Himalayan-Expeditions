Tidy Tuesday - Himalayan Expeditions


This repository has been built with the idea to have all my Exploratory Data Analysis related work on varied topics of Tidy Tuesday. 
The first of my work relates to Tidy Tuesday - Himalayan Expeditions data set where I have studied the data and brought out some beautiful plots explaining the data on the Himalayan Expeditions

The link to the date set is :- https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/himalayan-expeditions

All my credits to the above user who has uplaoaded this data set and also to have cleaned and made the raw data tidy for it to be used for EDA directly. I have just applied transformations on the data using dplyr and used the ggplot2 packages to bring out different insightful plots on the data.
